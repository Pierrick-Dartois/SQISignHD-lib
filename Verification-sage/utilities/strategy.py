    Adapted from optimised_strategy when the fist isogeny evaluation is more costly.
    This is well suited to gluing comptations. Computes optimal strategies with constraint
    at the beginning. This takes into account the fact that doublings on the codomain of 
    the first isogeny are impossible (because of zero dual theta constants).

    CAUTION: When splittings are involved, do not use this function. Use 
    optimised_strategy_with_first_eval_and_splitting instead.

    INPUT:
    - n: number of leaves of the strategy (length of the isogeny).
    - mul_c: relative cost of one doubling compared to one generic 2-isogeny evaluation.
    - first_eval_c: relative cost of an evaluation of the first 2-isogeny (gluing) 
    compared to one generic 2-isogeny evaluation.

    internal node of the strategy, where indices are ordered depth-first left-first
